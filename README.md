# LiveORC
Web-based, professional and scalable velocimetry analysis for operational river monitoring with videos

# Installation
By far the easiest way to start working with LiveORC is to use docker and the liveorc.sh bash script bundled with the code. To use this script you will need a bash environment. Under most linux environments and mac OS this is available as is in any terminal window you may open. Under windows, you can use the script e.g. under git bash or in the Windows Subsystem for Linux environment (WSL).

## prerequisites


## local use

If you wish to use LiveORC on your own local network only, then the installation process is as simple as calling

```
./liveorc.sh start
```

## Installation for use on a public internet address.

For more scalable use on the internet you will have to expose the code on a public web address and ensure that traffic from and to the site is secure. To do this you need to acquire a hostname
